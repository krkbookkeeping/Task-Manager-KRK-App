Project Overview
This is a cloud-based task management web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Firebase (Firestore) as the sole persistence layer for authentication and data storage. The user signs in via Firebase Authentication and all data syncs in real time across devices. There is no local storage of any kind.
Workspaces
The account represents a single user, but within that account are multiple completely isolated Workspaces. Workspaces function like separate profiles inside one account — each one represents a different company or client (for example, different bookkeeping clients). Data never overlaps between workspaces. Each workspace contains its own boards, tasks, labels, settings, ordering, and archives. The user can switch between workspaces from a persistent workspace switcher in the app's navigation — switching workspaces reloads the entire working context into that profile. When inside a workspace, all search, filters, and dashboards operate exclusively within that workspace.
Boards Screen
The Boards Screen exists inside a selected Workspace and lists all Boards for that workspace. A Board represents a major operational area within a workspace. In many cases a workspace may contain only one primary board, but the structure supports multiple. Each board displays its name, an optional short description, and an optional color accent for visual distinction. Boards can be created, renamed, reordered, and archived. Archiving a board hides it from the main list but allows restoration from an "Archived Boards" toggle view. Boards cannot be permanently deleted without an explicit confirmation step. The Boards Screen is optimized for desktop but remains usable on mobile.
Board Dashboard Layout
Inside a Board, the primary working interface is the Board Dashboard. The layout has three regions: a left-side calendar column, a main bucket grid in the center and right, and a search bar centered at the very top of the page spanning above both the calendar and the bucket area. The bucket grid displays a responsive arrangement of Buckets. This dashboard is not a traditional Kanban board — it is a label-driven operational control center built to answer the question: "What buckets are full right now?"
Labels and Buckets
Labels are the structural backbone of the dashboard. Each label generates one Bucket — a dashboard card displaying all active tasks assigned to that label. A task can have multiple labels and therefore appear in multiple buckets. Labels have a name and an optional color. Labels can be created and managed in three places: from within the Task Detail panel via a label selector with a "create new label" option, from a bucket header control, and from a dedicated Label Management section inside workspace Settings.
Empty buckets collapse by default into a thin header row showing the label name and a task count of zero. The user can manually expand or collapse any bucket. The global default collapse behavior for empty buckets is controlled in workspace Settings. A bucket containing only archived or completed tasks is treated as empty in the active view. Buckets can be reordered by dragging to match the user's current workflow priorities.
Tasks
Tasks are the central unit of work. Each task contains: a title (inline editable), description and notes (larger editable text field), a due date (set via date picker), multiple labels (selected via a dropdown with checkboxes and a "create new" option), a pinned state, a manual sort order within its bucket, a comment stream, attachments, a completion state, and an archive state.
Pinning a task moves it to the top of the specific bucket it was pinned within. Pinning is bucket-scoped, not global — pinning a task in one bucket does not affect its position in other buckets where it also appears.
Completion and Archive
Completion and archive are handled as a unified off-dashboard state. When a task is marked complete, it is immediately removed from the active dashboard view and moved to the Archive. The Archive is a dedicated view that contains both completed and manually archived tasks. Completed tasks display their completion date. Archived tasks can be viewed via a "Show Archive" toggle or dedicated archive screen within the workspace. The main dashboard never shows completed or archived tasks unless that toggle is explicitly activated. Screen real estate on the active dashboard is reserved entirely for tasks that still require attention.
Task Detail Panel
The Task Detail panel opens as a right-side slide-over panel on desktop and a full-screen modal on mobile. The left section of the panel contains the title, description, due date picker, and label selector. The right section contains the chronological comment feed and attachment area. Comments are time-stamped. Users can paste screenshots directly into the comment area, which uploads the image and displays an inline thumbnail. Attachments display as mini thumbnail previews inside the task detail panel, and a small preview indicator appears on the task card itself in the bucket. Clicking any thumbnail opens a full-size preview modal.
Task Cards
Each task card displayed inside a bucket shows the task title, due date if set, a label indicator, an attachment indicator if attachments exist, and a completion checkbox. Pinned tasks appear at the top of their bucket with a visible pin indicator. Completed tasks are immediately removed from the card view upon completion.
Calendar Panel
The calendar panel on the left side of the dashboard functions as both a filter and a scheduling tool. Clicking a single date filters all buckets to show only tasks due on that date. Clicking the same date again clears the filter. Clicking and dragging across dates selects a date range, with the range visually highlighted during the drag. Pressing Escape immediately clears any active filter. When a filter is active, a visible filter indicator displays above the bucket grid so the user always knows the dashboard is in a filtered state. Calendar filtering never modifies task data unless a drag-and-drop action occurs. Dragging a task onto a calendar date highlights the target date cell before drop, and dropping assigns or replaces the task's due date immediately without a confirmation dialog. If a date range is active and a task is dropped onto a specific date cell, the exact cell date becomes the new due date — never the full range.
Drag and Drop
Drag-and-drop is a core advanced feature throughout the dashboard. Users can drag tasks within a bucket to manually reorder them. Users can drag entire buckets to reorder the dashboard layout. Users can drag tasks from one bucket to another. Cross-bucket drag behavior is configured in workspace Settings via a clearly labeled option: "When I drop a task into another bucket, default action is:" with two choices — Add Label (the task keeps its original bucket context and gains the new label) or Change Task (the task's primary bucket becomes the new bucket, replacing its previous label context). Holding Shift while dropping performs the opposite of the configured default, giving power users fast access to both behaviors. All drag operations provide clear visual feedback throughout the interaction. No drag operation ever causes accidental data loss. All reordering, label changes, and due date updates persist instantly to Firestore and sync across devices in real time.
Search
A search bar is positioned at the top center of the Board Dashboard, spanning above both the calendar and bucket areas. Search operates within the currently active workspace only and searches task titles, descriptions, and comments. A toggle allows the user to include archived and completed tasks in search results. There is no cross-workspace search.
Mobile
The app is optimized for desktop use with full drag-and-drop interaction. On mobile, buckets stack vertically, the calendar collapses into a toggleable drawer, and the Task Detail panel becomes a full-screen modal. Drag-and-drop may be simplified on mobile, but core task editing, filtering, commenting, and viewing must remain fully functional.
Data and Sync
All data — workspaces, boards, labels, tasks, comments, attachments, ordering, settings, and archive states — is stored in Firestore and synchronized across devices in real time. Firebase Authentication manages user identity. There is no fallback to local storage under any circumstance.
